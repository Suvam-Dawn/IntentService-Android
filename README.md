# IntentService-Android

If Application has long running tasks, then may need to consider implementing services to run those log running operations in the background. Service like activity is a component in android. Services can be created by extending Service class and implementing required callback methods. Services created by extending Service class handle multiple requests concurrently and they run in the main thread. But if your requirement is that each service request be handled one at a time and in separate work thread, then the best way to create it is by extending IntentService class. IntentService class provides framework to take care of queuing requests, executing request one at time in worker thread and stopping service when not used. In this post, I will show how to implement IntentService.
